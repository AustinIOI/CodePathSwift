# Prework - *SwiftCodePathApp*

Submitted by: **Austin Yu**

**SwiftCodePathApp** is an app that allows users to interact with a simple UI containing three labels and a button. When the button is tapped, the app's background color changes to a random color. This project demonstrates basic iOS development skills using Swift and Xcode.

Time spent: **3 hours** spent in total

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### My Favorite Apps

1. **Instagram**

   - Provides smart recommendations for music discovery.
3. **Duolingo**

### App Idea

I would like to build an app called **Mood Tracker**, which helps users monitor and improve their emotional well-being. Key features include:
- Users can log their mood at different times of the day.
- A visual dashboard shows mood trends over weeks and months.
- Integrates tips for relaxation and motivational quotes based on mood patterns.

## Notes

Challenges I encountered while building this app:
- Understanding how to connect Storyboard UI elements to Swift code using `@IBOutlet` and `@IBAction`.
- Debugging minor Auto Layout issues when setting up the UI.
